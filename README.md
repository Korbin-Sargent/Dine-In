# Dine In

## Group Project 1

As new developers we were assigned the task as a group project to create a website that utilized Third Party API's.

We had two possible avenues we wanted to pursue for this project. The first being a website that pulled information from NASA’s API portal to determine meteor showers in conjunction with a weather API to assure viewers had a clear sky to gaze upon in their selected location. After doing some preliminary research into the NASA API, we decided that this route was perhaps too ambitious for our first group project.

Thus, we decided to go in the direction of our second choice which was a website that aims to help its users simplify the age-old question, “What do we want for dinner?” Our website’s inspiration stems from those indecisive individuals or even those just pressed for time to plan a fun night at home cooking. Our website Dine In, prompts the user to filter their preferences such as main protein or ethnic food category and a random recipe generator will come back with a tasty selection with the added bonus of a drink selection to go with the meal. Each meal selection card takes the user to a new page which lists ingredients, preparation and cooking instructions. Cooking at home made easy and therefore more fun. The users are left with additional time in their day to focus on more important matters and time with family.
