## Group Project 1

As new developers we are assigned to create a website that utilized Third Party API's.
Our project is a recipe and drink generator, baised on a filtered requirements from the user. 
We had two topics for this project, the other was a API that used NASA's info to determine meteor shows but decided that was an intense for the goal of it.

## Troubleshooting

<!-- ----------------------- -->
The first step of this project was to visually agree upon a layout to acheive the rrequirements for the website.
We first created the layout by using the Draw.io which helped us visually see what we can do with our knowlege
on API's and make the JS work along with the html. This gave us a better understanding on what was possible and time
mange us the best way possible.
